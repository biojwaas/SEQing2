# SEQing2
An interactive web-based tool for visualization of iCLIP and RNA-seq data.  The goal of this project is to develop a generalized, web-based, interactive visualization and exploration tool for iCLP and RNA-seq data. The application case is a local machine inside the users network, allowing members a web-based (browser) access to explore their experimental data omitting any local installations.
